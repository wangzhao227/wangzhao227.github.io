Hello! I’m a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), University of Cambridge, working with Professor Raymond E. Goldstein FRS. 

I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2025 under the supervision of Prof. Alan C. H. Tsang, following my M.Sc. from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2021.

My main research interests lie at the intersection of biophysics and biofluid mechanics. I combine theoretical and experimental approaches to understand non-equilibrium phenomena in nature. My work revolves around exploring fundamental questions, such as:

*   How do microorganisms adapt their behavior and navigation strategies in response to environmental cues?
*   How do multicellular organisms coordinate individual actions to achieve collective navigation?
*   How do cells robustly construct their external architectures?

If my research resonates with you and you'd like to discuss it further, please don't hesitate to email me.
